	<h1> Welcome to Billy Armfield's Homepage!</h1>
	<h2> I would love to join ADI labs... </h2>
	<p> What's up ADI!! My favorite color is baby blue, natch. </p>
	<p> I'm an intelligent systems track CS major, and would love to work on spaCy, Density, or Jupyter! </p>
	<p> Really, I just want to meet people in the major, learn like crazy, and have fun. Hope to see you all soon!
	<p> In the meantime, please enjoy this picture of my dog plotting to kill me because I put him in an elf costume.
